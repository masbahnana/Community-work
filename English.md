Hi! I am Natalia Raythz and in this repository you will find all the information about my public lectures (past, present and future).

## Do you want to invite me to your conference?

My areas of interest are software testing, infrastructure (IaaS), claud computing, SRE, development in Python and Ruby languages, quality and software engineering. I also talk about diversity, accessibility and inclusion.

To get in touch you can open an issue in this repository or send me an email (natr@hey.com) containing information about the conference.

Below is my biography in different formats, photo and all my lectures.

*Note: I am an autistic person*

## Biography

Natália Raythz is a Brazilian living in Ireland and an IT professional with a background in infrastructure and development, currently working as a Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat.

Always delving into learning more about SRE, testing software outside the standard of the testing pyramid and automating everything I can.

Always trying to be as active as possible in the community as a speaker or giving workshops, but today her main focus is to mentor underrepresented people. Today Natalia is a mentor in two projects: Imoye, which is focused on mentoring black women, and + 1Code, which is focused on including peripheral people in the technology area.

In her free time, Natalia likes to draw, read and go to the Marina (Dun Laoghaire / Ireland).
