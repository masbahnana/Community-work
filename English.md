## Do you want to invite me to your conference?

I am a technologist person and have many areas of interest, among them are: Quality culture, quality engineering (testing and methodologies), open source, automation, communities, mentoring, diversity, accessibility and inclusion.

To contact me you can open an issue in this repository or send me an email (<natr@hey.com>) containing the information about the conference.

Below is my bio in several formats, photo and all my talks.

## A little bit about me

Nana da Silva is a Brazilian living in Ireland and an IT professional with a background in infrastructure and development, currently working as a Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat.

Always deep into learning and teaching, my hard skills are in the areas of quality, testing and infrastructure.

Always trying to be as active as possible in the community as a speaker or giving workshops, but today her main focus is mentoring underrepresented people. Today Nana is a mentor in two projects Imoye which is focused on mentoring black women.

### Disclaimer

Some of my lectures you will find with my "dead name" (Natalia Raythz) and most of them are in Portuguese because even though I live in Ireland I am very active in the Brazilian communities.
